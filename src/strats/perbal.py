# This is the "percent balance" strategy. If my understanding of index funds is
# correct, this is effectively emulating an index fund.
# 
# It looks at all the assets in the account, and uses user-chosen percents of
# how much money the asset should make up. With these percents, at each tick,
# it looks at how far above/under each asset has gone in its percent, and makes
# buy/sell orders accordingly to set the percents back to what they were.
# This means assets that increased will have part of it sold, and that money
# will be used to invest in assets that decreased. Overall, hopefully it should
# increase.
#
# Thanks Dad for showing me how to do this manually on a spreadsheet. That's
# what got me thinking about writing this program.
